# **NGS Bioinformatics Course Materials**  

## **About**  
This repository contains **practical assignments, scripts, and learning materials** from the **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Bioinformatics Course**. The course provides a **comprehensive introduction** to modern sequencing data analysis, covering:  

- **Fundamental NGS concepts** (sequencing technologies, data formats, quality control)  
- **Bioinformatics workflows** (read alignment, variant calling, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, etc.)  
- **Hands-on computational skills** (Linux, Bash, Python/R for bioinformatics, pipeline tools)  

The structured curriculum is designed for **biologists, bioinformaticians, and data scientists** seeking to develop **practical NGS analysis skills**.
